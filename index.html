I started my software development adventure with the PHP language, which was my first eye pain. During these processes, I learned the hosting structure, domain and DNS logic. I took part in some student projects throughout my university life. During my university education, I wanted to improve myself by taking freelancer jobs. I mainly use PHP as the software language in the companies I work for. Along with PHP, I am trying to use current frameworks (Symfony, Laravel etc.). I also know C# .Net and JavaScript languages. I'm using JavaScript with the ES6 standard. In order to improve myself, I added Nginx, Docker, Amazon Web Services (AWS) to the technologies that I add to myself. Along with all this, I learned Unix systems, bash, terminal (console), SSH. On the server side, my most preferred operating system is Ubuntu. In some cases, I prefer CentOS or a different up-to-date version, AlmaLinux. I learned network technologies and security layers such as virtual network, firewall, proxy. I continue to add value to myself."/><link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="logo192.png"/><link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json"/><meta property="twitter:image" content="/social-image.png"/><meta property="og:image" content="/social-image.png"/><title>Harun GEÇİT | Personal GitHub Website</title><script defer="defer" src="/static/js/main.14bd1116.js"></script><link href="/static/css/main.778eeed7.css" rel="stylesheet"></head><body><noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript><div id="root"></div></body></html>
